  <summary>üì¶ Modular Monolith with Clean Architecture</summary>

  **What**:
  * The entire codebase lives in a single repository but is strictly layered:

  1. Domain (core business models & interfaces)
  2. Application (use‚Äëcase orchestration)
  3. Adapters (HTTP, DB, cache, external APIs)

  **How**:
  * Each layer depends only on the layer immediately beneath it. We use Go‚Äôs module system to enforce clear import boundaries, and interfaces to decouple business logic from transport or persistence.

  **Why**:
  * You get the simplicity of a monolith for local development and CI‚Äëruns, plus the clean seams you need to slice off services into microservices or serverless functions later.
</details>


<details>
  <summary>üîó API‚ÄëFirst Design</summary>

  **What**:
  * Every endpoint is defined in an OpenAPI 3.0 spec.

  **How**:
  * We use oapi-codegen to generate both server stubs and TypeScript/Go clients directly from openapi.yaml. Our CI job runs a diff on the spec to catch accidental breaking changes.

  **Why**:
  * Guarantees end‚Äëto‚Äëend contract consistency, speeds up frontend integration, and provides interactive Swagger UI for internal and beta consumers.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ö° Performance Optimizations</summary>

  **Redis Caching**:
  * Query‚Äëlevel caching with 5‚Äëminute TTL for ‚Äúread‚Äêheavy‚Äù endpoints (e.g. library listings).
  * Cache invalidation hooks in our repository layer ensure data freshness on writes.

  **PostgreSQL Partitioning & Indexing**:
  * Time‚Äëseries tables (expense logs) are automatically partitioned by month to keep queries sub‚Äësecond.
  * Composite indexes on (owner_id, created_at) speed up user‚Äëscoped queries.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>üîí Security</summary>

  **JWT Authentication**:
  * Auth0‚Äëissued JWTs (RS256) with middleware handling validity of said JWTs.
  * Access and refresh tokens signed with RS256.
  * User‚Äëcontext validation on every endpoint
  * DB‚Äëbacked user existence checks and route protection.

  **Input Validation & XSS Prevention**:
  * `bluemonday.StrictPolicy()` sanitizes any HTML inputs
  * Regex‚Äëbased whitelists for query parameters
  * Strict JSON schema and URL‚Äëparam validation

  **SQL Injection & Data Integrity**:
  * All DB interactions use parameterized queries and transactions
  * Foreign‚Äëkey constraints enforce referential integrity
  * User‚Äëscoped filtering ensures zero lateral data access

  **Rate Limiting & Throttling**:
  * Redis‚Äëbacked rate limiter (configurable request per user)
  * Token‚Äëbucket algorithm to smooth bursts

  **CORS & Network Protections**:
  * Fine‚Äëgrained CORS policy allows only approved origins
  * Private VPC connectivity (production) or Docker bridge (local)

  **Error Handling & Monitoring**:
  * Structured JSON logs with request IDs (ELK/Loki compatible)
  * Sentry.io integration for exception tracking and alerts

  **Cache Security**:
  * User‚Äëscoped Redis keys with proper invalidation hooks
  * No sensitive data persisted in cache

</details>


<details>
  <summary>üöÄ Infrastructure & DevOps</summary>

  **Observability & Monitoring**:
  * Structured logging with request tracing across frontend and backend
  * Custom log formats with user context, performance metrics, and error correlation
  * Centralized logging with Sentry integration for error tracking and alerting

  **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  * GitHub Actions with matrix builds (Go 1.19‚Äì1.21) and multi-arch Docker images
  * Database migrations and seeding with rollback capabilities
  * Backup/restore workflows with timestamped snapshots

  **Multi-Environment Containerization**:
  * Docker Compose orchestration with Traefik reverse proxy, PostgreSQL 14, Redis 7, and Sentry.io monitoring
  * Environment isolation with separate `.env` files for dev/test/prod
  * Health checks and graceful degradation across all services
  * Multi-stage Dockerfiles with optimized production builds

  **Cloudflare Deployments**:
  * Frontend & marketing on Pages with immutable previews
  * API gateway and edge functions on Workers for global low-latency
  * CDN optimization with automatic cache invalidation

  **Development Experience**:
  * Single-command workflows (`make dev-backend`, `make reset`)
  * Intelligent Vite control with network diagnostics and auto-recovery

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
*  Docker (20.10.0+)
* Docker Compose (2.0.0+)
* Make

### Getting Started (Beta)
1. Pull down the full repo.

2. Check out the .env files for both `/backend` and `/frontend` directories.\
   QKO requires many env vars set up prior to attempting to build.\
   Please examine the `.env.sample` files to get started.

3. *Marketing + Frontend:*\
   After you have set up `.env` vars, check out the `vite-control.sh` script in both directories.\
   Use this build script to get you up and running quickly.\
   Both scripts come with complete documentation.\
   Run `./vite-control.sh help` in both directories to get started.

4. *Backend:*\
   Install Docker locally then look for the Makefile in the root directory.\
   This file also has complete documentation.\
   Run `make help` to get started.

5. Both Frontend + Backend must be running in order to run the build locally.

## Roadmap

*  ‚ù§Ô∏è Wishlist Section - Save games to your wishlist and track when they go on sale across multiple vendor APIs
*  üíπ More detailed expense reporting dashboard - download reports and track expenditures from all months of the year
*  ‚ú® Updated themes - Game inspired UI
*  üåê Multi language support
