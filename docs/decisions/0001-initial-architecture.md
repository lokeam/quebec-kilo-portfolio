Author: A.M. Loke

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Building a modern Go web service that balances several concerns:

- Maintainability and code organization
- Performance and scalability
- Developer experience
- Production readiness
- Testing capabilities

Key requirements:

- RESTful API serving book management functionality
- Authentication and authorization
- Caching for performance optimization
- Robust error handling and logging
- Production-grade monitoring

## Decision
Implement a clean architecture with the following key components:

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- Chi router for HTTP routing
  - Lightweight, standards-compliant
  - Rich middleware ecosystem
  - Built on native net/http
  - Excellent performance characteristics

- Structured logging (Zap + slog)
  - Zero-allocation logging
  - Contextual logging support
  - Color-coded development logs
  - JSON production logs

- Database & Caching
  - PostgreSQL for persistent storage
    - ACID compliance
    - Complex query support
    - Strong data integrity
  - Redis for caching
    - In-memory performance
    - Distributed caching support
    - Pub/sub capabilities

### 2. Architecture Patterns
- Clean Architecture layers:
  ```
  HTTP → Handlers → Services → Repositories → Database
  ```
- Domain-Driven Design principles
  - Bounded contexts (auth, books, games)
  - Rich domain models
  - Aggregate roots

### 3. Development Practices
- Dependency injection for testability
- Interface-driven design
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Environment-based configuration
- Comprehensive error handling

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Benchmark tests for critical paths
- Mock interfaces for external dependencies

### 5. Security Measures
- Auth0 Integration
  - OpenID Connect compliance
  - OAuth 2.0 flows
  - Social login support
  - MFA capabilities (TBD)
- API Security
  - Rate limiting for endpoint protection
  - CORS configuration for web clients
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - HTTPS enforcement in production

### 6. Performance Considerations
Initial Focus:
- Response time optimization
  - Efficient database queries
  - Proper indexing
  - Request/response caching
- Resource utilization
  - Connection pooling
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - Memory management

Future Benchmarks:
- API response targets
- Cache efficiency goals
- Scalability metrics
- Deployment strategies

### 7. Observability
Initial Implementation:
- Structured logging (Zap+slog)
  - Request/response logging
  - Error tracking with stack traces
  - Performance timing logs
- Basic health check endpoint
  - Database connectivity
  - Redis availability
  - Application status

Future Considerations:
- Metrics collection (e.g., Prometheus)
- Distributed tracing
- Advanced monitoring (e.g., Grafana)

## Rationale
- Chi over alternatives (Gin, Echo):
  - Standard library compatibility
  - Lower learning curve
  - Better maintainability
  - Proven production usage

- Zap+slog over alternatives:
  - Superior performance
  - Colorized, native structured logging
  - Future-proof (slog is standard library)
  - Production-ready features

- Clean Architecture benefits:
  - Clear dependency flow
  - Easier testing
  - Maintainable codebase
  - Scalable structure

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable architecture
- Production-ready logging
- Easy onboarding for Go developers
- Scalable foundation
- Performance-optimized stack

### Negative
- Initial setup complexity
- Learning curve
- More boilerplate than monolithic design

### Mitigations
- Comprehensive documentation (Document all the things)
- Clear code organization (Keep it clean)
- Consistent patterns (Do the right thing)
- Example implementations (Show me the code/tests)

## Implementation Notes
- Directory structure follows domain boundaries
- Middleware chain handles common concerns
- API versioning via URL path (/v1/...)
- Error handling is centralized
- Configuration uses environment variables
- Logging is context-aware
- Repository pattern for data access
- Factory pattern for dependency creation
- Strategy pattern for flexible behaviors
- Observer pattern for event handling
